# Scale-flux coordinates for saturated frozen second contacts

The saturated second-contact source already carries a strict smaller cutoff

`B = floor(X_R / A) < R`,

where `A = p * P(t)` is the first root-crossing source scale.  Writing the
frozen cofactor as `c = q*d`, with `q = P+(c)`, the existing factorization gives

`q*d <= B < q^2*d`.

This file records the two exact identities needed to interpret that statement as
a discrete scale flux rather than another owner count.

First, the #627 predecessor face obtained by erasing `q` has product exactly

`P(V) = A*d`.

Second, its signed source weight is exactly

`mu(A) * mu(d)`.

Thus the low first-crossing coordinate `A` and the stripped high cofactor `d`
are not auxiliary labels: together they are the literal predecessor state on
which the second contact acts.  The only scale left by the failed second contact
is the square-dilated descendant cutoff `B/q^2` already used by the Go wall
residual machinery.

No norm, estimate, PNT input, or asymptotic statement is introduced.
