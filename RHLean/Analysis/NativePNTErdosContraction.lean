# The generic Erdos cubic contraction

The elementary Selberg--Erdos proof of PNT produces nonnegative linear error
envelopes with a one-sided cubic improvement.  The natural abstract input is
therefore an inequality

`alpha_(n+1) <= alpha_n - C * alpha_n^3`, `C > 0`,

not an exact recurrence.

This module proves, independently of all number theory, that any nonnegative
envelope satisfying that inequality tends to zero.  The nonnegativity
hypothesis is intentionally explicit: together with the cubic improvement it
encodes the localization needed to keep the next envelope in the admissible
range.  Establishing that localization belongs to the prime-specific
application, not to this generic limit argument.

/-- A nonnegative cubic-improvement envelope has no positive limiting fixed
point: its only possible limit is zero.

The hypothesis is one-sided rather than an equality.  This is the form needed
for Selberg--Erdos applications, where the next envelope is obtained from an
upper bound rather than from an exact recurrence. -/
