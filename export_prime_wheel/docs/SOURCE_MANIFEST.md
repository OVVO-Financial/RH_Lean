# Source manifest

This note records the role of each Lean module published here. The arithmetic
and Fourier theorem files listed below carry the statements the manuscript
depends on; the bridge modules named further down isolate the published
theorem boundary.

## Exact merged source modules

### Analysis

- `RHLean/Analysis/FiniteTorusFourierPairing.lean`
- `RHLean/Analysis/PrimeWheelFourierReduction.lean`
- `RHLean/Analysis/PrimeWheelTorusRealization.lean`
- `RHLean/Analysis/PrimeWheelJointSpectrum.lean`

## Public bridge foundations

The public modules use role-specific names rather than internal paths whose names describe different theorem layers:

- `RHLean/Analysis/MertensEnergyCriterion.lean` defines the Mertens summatory function and squared growth criterion required by the exact reduction.
- `RHLean/Analysis/PrimeWheelRHBridge.lean` names Mathlib's `RiemannHypothesis` proposition and keeps the classical Mertens/RH theorem as an explicit argument.

`RHLean/Analysis/PublicPrimeWheelReduction.lean` exposes the final public theorem without a caller-supplied primorial bridge.

## Paper provenance

- Current manuscript: `paper/seeded_prime_comb_harmonic_reduction.tex`.
- The manuscript is **not** pinned by content hash. It is revised as research lands, so a recorded hash goes stale on the next edit and turns an ordinary paper revision into a failing build. Manuscript identity is carried by the Git history of the file itself.
- Public repository: `https://github.com/OVVO-Financial/prime-wheel-mobius`.
- Section 7 links directly to `numerics/primorial_block_validation.py`.

## Numerical provenance

- The validation program was renamed from `squared_space_reproducibility_v3.py` to `primorial_block_validation.py` without changing its bytes.
- Reused Git blob SHA for the renamed program: `98ad192eb59c1ad9cf31ab8cdbfc43cf0f8497ed`.
- `analytic_kill_gates.py` was updated only where necessary to load the renamed program.
- The numerical workflow records source SHA-256 values in `results/SOURCE_SHA256SUMS.txt`.
- The numerical workflow hashes every generated result artifact in `results/SHA256SUMS.txt`.
- Generated archive hashes can change when filenames, metadata, or output paths change; the validation program's content identity is recorded separately by the preserved Git blob SHA.

## Dependency pin

- Lean: `v4.24.0`
- Mathlib: `v4.24.0`
